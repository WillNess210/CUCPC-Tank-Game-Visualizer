# Tank Game AI Programming Competition - Visualizer
For information about the game itself, visit the Engine's github repo [here](https://github.com/WillNess210/CUCPC-Tank-Game-Engine). 

## Using The Visualizer
You can use the provided tank-vis.jar to watch replay files. The jar takes in one file parameter when running, which is the filepath to the log file. Here is an example call of the visualizer:
```
java -jar tank-vis.jar replays/latest_replay.log
```
